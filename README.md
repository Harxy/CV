## Skills

#### Technical Writing

Both in a team, using Jira in an Agile environment, and working solo, including owning my own company for contracting purposes. Communicated with stakeholders, ran usability testing, liased with developers about features, and completed release notes and all documentation for many software products.

- The above documentation was created in Wordpress with DITA methodologies, as the sole technical author of Netbiscuits.

#### Technical Writing Technologies

Having used a multitude of technologies to create technical documentation, I have somehow acquired a genuine interest in learning new ways to deliver help content:

- Madcap Flare, in which I am certified, focusing on content reuse for multiple outputs using single-sourcing, context-sensitive help and variables.
- Also proficient in Adobe Robohelp, a Help Authoring Tool similar to Flare.
- HTML solutions including [FlatDoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/) and [Fixie Docs](http://philips.github.io/fixiedocs/).
- Backend solutions like Jekyll and XML using DITA.
- Recently, using Github pages and simple Markdown to create developer-facing Github readmes.
- Will use Vim whenever anyone lets me.
