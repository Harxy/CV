## Paul Harker

Technical Writer and part-time coder. Seven years experience writing customer-facing software documentation and developer-facing API and integration guides, and now about a year coding in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

## Achievements

- Created, from scratch, many help systems using a variety of Technical Writing packages.
- Been part of teams that have completely redesigned existing help systems to focus on user-engagement, multiple outputs or converting to DITA methodologies.
- Completed [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), an intensive 12 week coding course that allows people without a coding background get to the stage where they can test-drive the development of web apps. 
- Code Club: having completed the course above, I was utilised by North Highland to run monthly code meetups for non-technical staff, to give them insight into how their developers work.

## Skills

#### Technical Writing

Both in a team, using Jira in an Agile environment, and working solo, including owning my own company for contracting purposes. Communicated with stakeholders, ran usability testing, liased with developers about features, and completed release notes and all documentation for many software products.

- Created [documentation in Wordpress](http://www.netbiscuits.com/knowledge-base/) with DITA methodologies, as the sole technical author of Netbiscuits, a mobile analytics company.

#### Technical Writing Technologies

Having used a multitude of technologies to create technical documentation, I have somehow acquired a genuine interest in learning new ways to deliver help content:

- Madcap Flare, in which I am certified, focusing on content reuse for multiple outputs using single-sourcing, context-sensitive help and variables.
- Also proficient in Adobe Robohelp, a Help Authoring Tool similar to Flare.
- HTML solutions including [FlatDoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/) and [Fixie Docs](http://philips.github.io/fixiedocs/).
- Backend CMS solutions like Jekyll, Wordpress or XSL/XML using DITA.
- Recently, using Github pages and simple Markdown to create developer-facing Github readmes (like this one!).
- Will use Vim whenever anyone lets me.
